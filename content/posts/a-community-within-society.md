title: A community within society
author: Giorgio Agamben

---
Italy, as Western political laboratory, wherein the dominant powers' strategies are put to test in their extreme form, is today a country humanly and politically in shambles, in which a reckless  tiranny ready to do anything is aligned with masses fallen prey to a pseudoreligious terror, ready to sacrifice not only those which were once constitutional liberties but even the warmth of human relations. Believing that the _greenpass_ would ever mean return to normality is really naive. As a third shot is already underway, more will be imposed and more and new emergencies and red zone will be declared until the government and the powers which are expressed through it will deem it useful. Those who incautiously complied will be the first to taste the consequences.  
In these conditions, without renouncing any possible tool of immediate resistance, dissidents will need to create something like a society within society, a community of friends and neighbors inside the society of enmity and distance. The forms of this new clandestine way ,  which will need to become as autonomous as possible from institutions, will need to be from time to time though out and experimented but only they will warrant  human survival in a world which has been devoted to a more or less conscious self-destruction.
